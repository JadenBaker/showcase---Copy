The code is ready for hosting with the following lines of code

const apiUrl = window.location.protocol === 'file:'
  ? 'http://localhost:8080' // Local API server during development
  : ''; // Production API

You can get the server started by running (python3 server.py) in the server directory from a windows terminal
